**Prompt and Context:**  
Prompt:  
For each function that has a function comment associated with it, convert the comment into a JSDoc style comment. If a function doesn't have a comment associated with it, don't add a comment to it. Here is an example of a JSDoc style comment for a basic function:  
/**
 * Adds two numbers together.
 * @param {number} a - The first number
 * @param {number} b - The second number
 * @returns {number} The sum of a and b
 */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

Here is an example of a JSDoc style comment for a function with an optional parameter:  
/**
 * Creates a greeting message.
 * @param {string} name - The person's name
 * @param {string} [greeting="Hello"] - Optional greeting prefix
 * @returns {string} The greeting message
 */
function greet(name, greeting = "Hello") {
  return `${greeting}, ${name}!`;
}
